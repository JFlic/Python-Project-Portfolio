# details on tank game 1.0
This is my first try at making my tank game. For the most part I was just trying to get the basic physics right before moving on to 2.0.

# details on tank game 2.0
This is a tank game that I designed using Python/Pygame. Unlike Tank game 1.0 this tank game is at least a 
functional game In this program I used data type manipulation, trigonometry, photoshop 
and made my own game physics. I might pick this up later and make it have more levels.
